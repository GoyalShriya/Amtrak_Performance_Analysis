### 🔍 Key Insights

* **Performance Trends:** Northeast Corridor routes achieved the best on-time rates; Midwest and Southern routes were most affected by freight interference.
* **Ridership Growth:** States like **Pennsylvania** and **Delaware** showed strong ridership rebound post-pandemic, linked to Amtrak Guest Rewards engagement.
* **Budget Gaps:** High-growth states (e.g., **Kentucky +56.6%**, **Alabama +47.9%**) received comparatively low funding, signaling allocation inefficiencies.
* **Operational Drivers:** Staffing specialization and track congestion were stronger predictors of delays than passenger or employment volume.
