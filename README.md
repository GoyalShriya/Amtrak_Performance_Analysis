## Amtrak On-Time Performance Dashboard

This project examines Amtrak’s on-time performance over the past three fiscal years to uncover key trends in service reliability, travel behavior, and operational efficiency. The objective is to identify growth opportunities and design data-driven strategies that enhance ridership, optimize performance, and elevate customer satisfaction across the network.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers Amtrak’s operations from FY2021 to FY2023, focusing on train punctuality, route-level delays, and regional performance. Data was processed and visualized through a relational database and interactive dashboards to highlight performance drivers and inform resource allocation strategies.

## Tools & Techniques

* **SQL (MySQL)** for data extraction, transformation, and analysis
* **Excel** for preprocessing, cleaning, and KPI calculations
* **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and geographic visualizations
* **Relational Database Design** using ER diagrams and schema normalization

## Key Insights

* **Performance Trends:** Northeast Corridor routes consistently outperformed long-distance services, with fewer freight-related delays.
* **Ridership Growth:** Mid-Atlantic states saw steady ridership recovery post-pandemic, correlating with improved service reliability.
* **Budget Inefficiencies:** Several high-growth states received lower funding per rider, indicating a mismatch between investment and demand.
* **Operational Factors:** Staffing structure and train congestion were stronger predictors of delay than employment or passenger volume.

## Recommendations

* Reinforce Amtrak’s right-of-way enforcement to reduce freight interference.
* Strengthen loyalty programs and digital experience to boost rider retention.
* Align funding with actual ridership growth and infrastructure needs.
* Introduce role-specific workforce tracking to identify operational bottlenecks.
